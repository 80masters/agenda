# DH5000 
## Agenda for Sept 29

- hook: Oblique Strategies for DH (or what Brian Eno & Mark Sample have in common)
- intro me: who I am, what I'm about.
- what DH looked like when I got started; my evolution.
- Q: what can DH be, per Sherrat & Posner?
- Q: what do *you* want DH to be?
	- t-p-s. What is your number 1 concern about this course? share with neighbour. Pair of you explain your concerns to another pair. Group of four explain to the rest of the group.

- Not going to define DH for you. Rather, the project in this class will be to craft a discipline-specific primer on DH for your home discipline. Build it to mitigate those fears.

## Getting set up with your own DH laboratory

- what does that even means?

> critical piece: code & transparency. Getting set up on github. Push, pull, fork & clone

- github exercise.
	- Download desktop client; differences between working on desktop/web 
	- Fork the digh5000 repo; clone on desktop. 
- markdown exercise. explain how this enhances sustainability of your research (note my reveal.js framework) 
	-use dillinger.io to see how markdown works.
	-Make a copy of the 'myname.md', rename it accordingly, add info to it.
- pandoc exercise (note all that pandoc can do). 
	-download & install pandoc
	-Use Pandoc to convert myname.md to a .pdf
- github exercise.
	Commit your changes; push your changes to your copy of the repo; sumbit a pull request to me to integrate your changes to the 'official' repo.

 ## things that now become available to you to do, now that you know these three parts.

 - eg: explaining open notebook humanities works (talk about Caleb McDaniel http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html)
- show Ryan, Christina xxxx repos: especially her map, show how forking etc creates a citation trail, an alternative way of assessing impact

With these skills, you are now equipped to participate in the wider life of the DH community. 

## some final nuts and bolts
- what 'community building' looks like in this course; how it'll be assessed
- schedule of seminars
- assignments & tool tutorials
- What to do for next week.
- other business?
